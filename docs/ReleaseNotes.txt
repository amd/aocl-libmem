AMD Memory/String Library - AOCL-LibMem Release Notes 4.0
---------------------------------------------------------

AMD AOCL-LibMem Contents
---------------------------

AOCL-LibMem is a library of the most widely used string/memory functions of
Glibc optimized for AMD Zen microarchitecture. This shared library should be
preloaded by application to replace standard string/memory functions for
better performance gains on AMD Zen microarchitectures.
a) By default this library will choose the best fit implementation w.r.t
the underlying micro-architectural support for CPU features, instructions,
cache, and threads per CCX.
b) This library also provides tunables for the user to choose specific
implementation of the function as per the application requirements.

Highlights of AMD AOCL-LibMem version 4.0
--------------------------------------------
 * Adding support for Zen4 architecture.
 * Adding support for AVX512 and choose the intruction and alignment
     with help of tunables.

Highlights of AMD AOCL-LibMem version 3.2.1
--------------------------------------------
 * Optimized functions for Zen1, Zen2 and Zen3 architectures.
    1. memcpy
    2. mempcpy
    3. memmove
    4. memset
    5. memcmp
 * Customized variants based on user choice via tunables from cmdline.
 * Micro architecture optimized default implementations.
 * Support for choosing AVX2 mov operations: {VMOVDQU, VMOVDQA,
         VMOVNTDQ, VMOVNTDQA} based on alignment/cache requirements.
 * Support for choosing ERMS rep-movs and rep-stos operations.
 * Support for tuning threshold for temporal, erms and non-temporal operations.
